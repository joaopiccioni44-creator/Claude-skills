Starcloud recently made history by launching a satellite with an NVIDIA H100 into orbit — the first time a GPU that
powerful has ever operated in space. It's the first step toward building AI data centers in orbit, powered by continuous
sunlight and cooled by radiating heat into deep space.  
  
Their approach could one day rival the world's biggest data centers while using less energy, zero fresh water, and far
lower emissions.  
  
In this episode of Hard Tech, YC's Aaron Epstein visits Starcloud's HQ, where co-founders Philip Johnston, Ezra Feilden,
and Adi Oltean explain how they built a working prototype in just 15 months — and why big tech is racing to space for AI
compute.
