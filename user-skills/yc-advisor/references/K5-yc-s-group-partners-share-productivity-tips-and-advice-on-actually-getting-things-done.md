For this episode of [**Office
Hours**](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/introducing-our-newest-video-series-office-hours), YC's Group Partners are
talking about productivity — what works for the founders they help, and, perhaps more importantly, what *doesn’t*.

In many cases, it’s about taking just a *bit* of time to get introspective; is that trendy new productivity tool
actually helping you get things done faster, or would a simple notes app/spreadsheet work better with the way you think?
How do you know if a task is real work or “fake” work — the stuff that *feels* like work, but isn’t actually moving your
startup forward?
