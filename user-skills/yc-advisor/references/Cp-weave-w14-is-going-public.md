Today, [Weave](https://www.getweave.com/), which was part of YC’s W14 batch, is going public. The founders of Weave,
brothers Brandon and Jared Rodman and their good friend Clint Berry didn’t, in all honesty, impress me when I read their
YC application. They seemed like nice guys who had just happened upon a sort of reasonable idea. I was wrong, and
luckily we chose to invite them in for an interview. In that interview, their focus and determination were apparent.
Their solution was built and worked, and their business was thriving. We were thrilled to fund them, and I quickly
became their biggest fan.

The ultimate story of Weave will best be told by Brandon, Jared, and Clint, but it is safe to say that it has been one
with epic ups and downs. Even before the batch started there was cleanup to do as the original company organization was
a complicated LLC which needed unwinding. And there was a cash crunch right away that needed resolution before the guys
got on the road to a successful Demo Day. The good news for Weave, is that the founders had actually built something
their customers wanted. The Weave solution, once integrated into an office, became fundamental to how that office ran –
thus, their churn stayed low and customer satisfaction high.

When Weave applied to YC, they supplied dentists with an all-in-one customer communications and management system. But
their vision was always a larger one. They recognized that the Weave solution fit the bill for many other small
health-related offices. I think, at least partially, the magnitude of this larger opportunity helped carry the team
through the inevitable ups and downs of a high-growth business. There would be future cash crunches to manage, crises
major and minor to overcome, and a business to expand. They kept at it, kept growing and the powerhouse company that is
Weave Communications emerged.

# What is Y Combinator?

We're an accelerator that funds startups — like Coinbase, Instacart, Reddit, Doordash — at their earliest stages. Starting a company? Even if it feels early, 40% of our companies joined with just an idea.

Today, the company still supports dental offices, but also optometrists, vets, and other medical offices with similar
capabilities. Tens of thousands of professional offices around the United States and Canada run their businesses using
Weave.

The very best founders refuse to give up; refuse to let their company die; refuse to lose belief in their product and
their vision. Brandon, Jared, and Clint worked incredibly hard, stayed the course and, as a result, Weave has become an
extraordinary success. We at YC could not be happier for them and the entire team at Weave. Congrats to Brandon, Jared,
Clint and everyone else at team Weave for today’s important milestone.
