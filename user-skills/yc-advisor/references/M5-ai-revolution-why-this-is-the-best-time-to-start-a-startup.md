In this special episode of Lightcone, we’re joined by YC partner and creator of Gmail, Paul Buchheit, to dig into some
of the latest trends in the world of AI and startups.

We recorded our conversation at a recent retreat where 300 of the top AI founders in the world gathered to share
expertise and make predictions about how this technology will shape our future.

In the discussion, we cover a wide range of topics, including the future of work, the power of agency and taste in an AI
world, and why this is the absolute best time to be building a startup.
