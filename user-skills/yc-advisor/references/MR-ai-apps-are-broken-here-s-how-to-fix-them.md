Many AI apps today feel like the "horseless carriages" of the late 19th century, which "swapped a horse for an engine
without redesigning the vehicle to handle higher speeds." They pack powerful tech into outdated interfaces.  
  
YC's Pete Koomen thinks we can do better.  
  
He joined Tom and Dave to lay out a new vision for how AI should actually work: not as a chatbot bolted onto legacy
software, but as a customizable tool that helps people offload the work they don't want to do.   
  
From editable system prompts to agents that act more like collaborators, they break down what it means to build
AI-native software—and why the future belongs to products that let users teach machines how they think.
