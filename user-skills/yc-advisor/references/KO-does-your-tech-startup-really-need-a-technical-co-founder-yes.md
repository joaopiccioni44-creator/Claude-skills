As YC Group Partners, we’re consistently surprised that anyone looking to start a VC-funded tech company would need to
be **convinced** they need a technical co-founder. The usual arguments are that no-code tools, part-time consultants, or
dev shops can allow anyone with a business idea to start a tech startup and raise money.  
  
*“New tools make starting a venture-funded tech company easy for anyone to do\!”* is an inspiring story that gets clicks
on LinkedIn...  but based on the thousands of companies YC has funded over the years, companies lacking a technical
co-founder underperform.  
  
In this episode of [**Dalton + Michael**](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), we’ll
discuss exactly why that is and why recruiting a technical co-founder is the single biggest way to create value as
someone trying to start the next big thing.
