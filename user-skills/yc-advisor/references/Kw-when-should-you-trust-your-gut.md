When you’re making important decisions as a founder — like what to build, or how it should work — should you spend lots
of time gathering input from others or just trust your gut?

The answer: it depends. It depends on who you are, what you’re building, and what *you* know here.

We often see founders getting it backwards. Some of the founders with the most expertise are the ones who hesitate to
build the thing they know the world needs, while founders without much experience want to spend the next five years
working on their vision before talking to anyone about it.

In this episode of [Dalton + Michael](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael) we talk more
about this, how to know when you should spend more time validating, and when to just commit.
