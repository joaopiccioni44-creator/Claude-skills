Suhail Doshi, a YC alumni who previously founded Mixpanel and Mighty, has created a state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI image
diffusion model with Playground. The app allows you to talk to it like a graphic designer and helps you create imagery
and text for a wide variety of use cases. In this episode of Lightcone, Suhail sits down with the hosts to talk about
his experience building Playground with his team, and what it takes to make a SOTA model.
