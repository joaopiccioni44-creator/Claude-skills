Getting people to visit your startup’s website is just step one. Getting them to actually sign up, buy something, or
even just care to learn more is a whole different challenge — and it’s one where good design is *crucial.*

For this episode of [Design Review](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Design%20Review), Aaron Epstein is
joined by YC’s [newest Group
Partner](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/meet-ycs-newest-group-partner-and-visiting-group-partners), Pete Koomen, to
cover some of the seemingly small things in a page’s design that can ultimately have huge impacts. Pete knows a thing or
two about this subject; before joining YC, he was a co-founder of
[Optimizely](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/optimizely), which helps thousands of companies run tests to figure
out which potential design changes work best.
