Paul Gross and his team at Remora are trying to do something that’s never been done before.

They're building mobile carbon capture devices for commercial trucks and trains—capturing CO2 from moving vehicles
before it enters the atmosphere, then turning those emissions into revenue by selling it to customers that can turn the
liquified CO2 into new products.

In this episode of Hard Tech, YC's Gustaf Alströmer visits Remora's headquarters outside Detroit to see how a recent
college grad with no engineering background is helping transform the $2 trillion transportation industry.
