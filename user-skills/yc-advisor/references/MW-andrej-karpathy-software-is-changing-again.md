Andrej Karpathy's keynote at AI Startup School in San Francisco. Slides provided by Andrej can be found

Drawing on his work at Stanford, OpenAI, and Tesla, Andrej sees a shift underway. Software is changing, again. We’ve
entered the era of “Software 3.0,” where natural language becomes the new programming interface and models do the rest.
  
  
He explores what this shift means for developers, users, and the design of software itself— that we're not just using
new tools, but building a new kind of computer.
