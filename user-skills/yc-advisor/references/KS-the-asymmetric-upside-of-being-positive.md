Many of us that are regular users of social media know that the snarkiest and most negative takes get the most
engagement. This can train us to optimize for pointing out all of the problems with things in the world in hopes of
being rewarded for it.

But this type of worldview doesn’t help founders building startups. The problems with any new startup are usually
obvious and numerous, but you have to balance that with seeing the upside of making it work.

In this episode of [Dalton and Michael](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), we’ll
discuss the best ways for founders and aspiring founders to think about weighing optimism and pessimism in their
day-to-day lives.
