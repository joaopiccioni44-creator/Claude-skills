# Decision Framework: Solo Founder vs Co-Founder

## Key Considerations

### Arguments for Having a Co-Founder

1. **Complementary skills** - Technical + Business, or different technical specialties
2. **Emotional support** - Startups have extreme lows; partners help you survive
3. **Accountability** - Harder to give up when others depend on you
4. **Velocity** - Two people can move faster on multiple fronts
5. **Signal to investors** - Solo founders face more skepticism
6. **Decision quality** - Someone to challenge your thinking

### Arguments for Going Solo

1. **Decision speed** - No debates or alignment needed
2. **Full ownership** - Keep 100% of equity
3. **No co-founder conflict risk** - Co-founder disputes kill many startups
4. **Right person unavailable** - Better solo than wrong co-founder
5. **Certain businesses** - Some work better with single vision

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Solo Better | Co-Founder Better |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Skills | You have all needed skills | Significant skill gaps |
| Network | Strong network for advice | Limited support network |
| Resilience | Very high stress tolerance | Need emotional support |
| Business type | Simple, focused product | Complex, multi-disciplinary |
| Funding plans | Bootstrapping | Raising venture capital |
