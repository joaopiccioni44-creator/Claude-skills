# Decision Framework: Do I Need a Technical Co-Founder?

## The Short Answer

## Why Technical Co-Founders Matter

1. **Speed** - Can build and iterate quickly without outsourcing delays
2. **Quality** - Understands what's possible, makes better technical decisions
3. **Cost** - Equity is better than paying contractors early on
4. **Credibility** - Investors and early employees want technical leadership
5. **Product intuition** - Technical founders often have better product sense for tech products

## When You Might Not Need One

2. **No-code viable** - Simple product that tools like Bubble can handle
3. **You can learn** - Willing to become technical yourself
4. **Strong technical advisors** - Can guide outsourced development
5. **Unique distribution** - Your advantage is entirely non-technical

## Alternatives to a Technical Co-Founder

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
