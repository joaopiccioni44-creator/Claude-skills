# Decision Framework: When to Pivot

## Signs You Should Consider Pivoting

### Strong Pivot Signals

1. **No user love** - Users are "meh" after months of iteration
2. **Acquisition impossible** - Can't get users at reasonable cost
3. **Market changed** - External factors invalidated your thesis
4. **Better opportunity** - Discovered something bigger while building
5. **Flat growth** - Tried everything, growth stalled
6. **You've lost passion** - Neither founder believes anymore

### Weaker Signals (May Not Need Pivot)

1. **Slow growth** - Could be execution, not idea
2. **Competitor launched** - Competition validates market
3. **Hard to build** - Technical challenges are solvable
4. **Takes time to sell** - B2B is naturally slower
5. **Investor rejection** - Investors are often wrong

## Pivot vs Persevere Questions

Ask these to determine the right move:

1. **Do you have any users who LOVE the product?** (Not like - LOVE)
   - If yes: Don't pivot, focus on that segment
   - If no: Strong pivot signal

2. **Is the problem real and painful?**
   - If yes: Pivot solution, not problem
   - If no: Find new problem

3. **Have you talked to 100+ users?**
   - If no: Do this before pivoting
   - If yes and no love: Pivot signal

4. **Is this the best use of your unique skills?**
   - If no: Consider pivot to better fit

5. **Do you still care about this problem?**
   - If no: Pivot for motivation reasons
