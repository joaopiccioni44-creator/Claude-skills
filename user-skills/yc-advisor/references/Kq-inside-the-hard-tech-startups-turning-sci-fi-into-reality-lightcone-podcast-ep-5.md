Most people know YC for funding software companies. But some of our most successful companies are the ones doing
incredible things in the real world — the hard tech companies. They’re 3D printing rockets, launching satellites into
space, engineering organisms, and developing fusion energy.

In this latest episode of [Lightcone](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Lightcone%20Podcast), Garry, Diana,
Harj and Jared talk about a number of YC’s hard tech companies, how far they’ve come since Day 1, and some of the ways
they got there faster.
