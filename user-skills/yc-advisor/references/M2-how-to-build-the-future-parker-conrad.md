In this episode of How to Build the Future, Garry sits down with Parker Conrad, Co-founder & CEO of Rippling, the all in
one HR, Finance and IT software company that’s valued at $13.5 billion. Parker is the co-founder of two unicorns and has
one of the more dramatic startup journeys in recent years. In this interview, he discusses his origin story, the lessons
learned from his first two companies, how AI is changing the game, and why he thinks the future will be defined by
"compound" software startups.
