Tom Brown co-founded Anthropic after helping build GPT-3 at OpenAI. A self-taught engineer, he went from getting a
B-minus in linear algebra to becoming one of the key people behind AI's scaling breakthroughs. And his work is paying
off.

Today, Anthropic's Claude is the go-to choice for developers, and his team is overseeing what he calls "humanity's
largest infrastructure buildout ever." On this episode of The Lightcone, he discusses his unconventional path from YC
founder to AI researcher, the discovery of scaling laws that changed everything, and his advice for young engineers
entering AI today.
