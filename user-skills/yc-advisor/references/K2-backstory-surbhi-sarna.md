When Surbhi Sarna was just thirteen, a sudden and excruciating pain in her side changed her life. The pain led to weeks
of testing and flimsy diagnoses that would ultimately boil down to “Cancer, maybe?”

herself.

In this debut episode of ‘Backstory’, she’ll do just that. [Learn more about this new series
