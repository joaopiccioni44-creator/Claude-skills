There aren’t a ton of people in the world who can say they founded a billion dollar company. There are far fewer that
can say they did it *twice*.

YC Group Partner [**Tom
Blomfield**](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/tom-blomfield-of-gocardless-and-monzo-is-our-newest-group-partner) is one
of them.

Each episode of [**our series Backstory** ](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/surbhi-sarna-backstory)introduces you to
one of YC’s Group Partners and the path they took to get here. This is Tom’s story.
