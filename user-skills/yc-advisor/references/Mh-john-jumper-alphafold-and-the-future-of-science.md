John Jumper on June 16, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

John Jumper is a physicist-turned-computational biologist who led DeepMind’s AlphaFold team—and earned the 2024 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for solving protein folding, a decades-old scientific challenge.

In this talk, he shares how a deep learning breakthrough at CASP14 turned into AlphaFold 1 and then AlphaFold 2,
delivering atomic accuracy predictions and revolutionizing biology. He explains the scientific puzzle behind protein
folding, the key algorithmic breakthroughs, and the impact of making millions of protein structures accessible to
researchers worldwide.
