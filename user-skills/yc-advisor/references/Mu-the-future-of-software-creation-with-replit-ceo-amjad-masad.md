Amjad Masad is the co-founder & CEO of Replit, now valued at $3B after a recent $250M Series C. He's spent nearly a
decade making programming accessible to all—and with the rise of AI, that vision is closer than ever.

In this talk from AI Startup School on June 17, 2025, Amjad traces the arc of computing from mainframes to personal
computers to a future where AI agents can create software on demand. He explains why the value of traditional software
will approach zero, fundamentally reshaping how companies are built and how work gets done.
