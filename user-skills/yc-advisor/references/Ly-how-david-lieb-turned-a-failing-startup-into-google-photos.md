YC General Partner David Lieb’s story is all about perseverance. In 2008, he co-founded Bump, an app used by 150M people
to share photos and contact info by bumping their phones together. Though he couldn’t find a way to turn it into a
sustainable business, he didn’t quit. Instead, he and his team pivoted several times, got acquired, and eventually went
on to build Google Photos. In this episode of Backstory, David shares his advice for finding the right idea, what
mistakes to avoid and how to maintain a positive mindset no matter what gets thrown at you.
