A fireside with Dr. Fei-Fei Li on June 16, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.

Dr. Fei-Fei Li is often called the godmother of AI—and for good reason. Before the world had AI as we know it, she was
helping build the foundation.

In this fireside, she recounts the creation of ImageNet, a project that helped ignite the deep learning revolution by
providing the data backbone modern computer vision needed. She walks through the early belief in data-driven methods,
the shock of seeing convolutional networks outperform expectations in 2012, and how those breakthroughs led to
captioning, storytelling, and ultimately, generative models.

Now, she’s taking on one of AI’s hardest frontiers: spatial intelligence. Fei-Fei shares why modeling the 3D world is
essential for AGI—and why it may be even more difficult than language.
