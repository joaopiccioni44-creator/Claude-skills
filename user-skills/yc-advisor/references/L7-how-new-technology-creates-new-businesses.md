When a major new technology comes out, huge new opportunities open up for founders that get in on the ground floor.
Fortunes were made when the app store came out, when online payments became easy, and when the web itself was brand new.

Moments like these don’t happen often. When they do, it’s the people that put themselves right at the bleeding edge that
find the opportunities — the people who pay attention to each new thing, pull threads, and search for the problems they
can solve now that no one could solve before. It’s the people who stay informed and *move* that get to choose their
paths.

In this episode of [Dalton and Michael](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael) we’ll talk
about why this is that moment for AI, who will find those opportunities, and where to look for the people that’ll help
you find them faster.
