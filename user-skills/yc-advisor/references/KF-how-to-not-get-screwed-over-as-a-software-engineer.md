The stories are true: technical founders (and early technical employees\!) often end up with the short end of the stick
when starting a company.

In this episode of [**Dalton & Michael**](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/carousel/Dalton%20&%20Michael), we’ll
discuss the questions and best practices that an aspiring founder (who happens to be technical) should think about —
whom to start a company with, and how to think about things like equity split and division of responsibilities.

Technical folks: know what you are worth and act accordingly\!
