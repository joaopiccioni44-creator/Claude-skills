After co-founding the successful Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus, Carl Pei felt the tech industry was missing the fun
and wonder he remembered as a dedicated gadget fan growing up in Sweden. Pei decided to launch a new smartphone brand,
this time with an increased focus on thoughtful user interface and stylish yet practical designs. In only two years, the
brand known as "Nothing" has gained a cult following and gone to $600 million in annualized revenue. On this episode of
The Main Function, Pei reflects on the highs and lows that have come with the journey of pursuing excellence in hard
tech.
