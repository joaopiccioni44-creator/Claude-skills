Cursor Head of Design Ryo Lu has spent his career at the intersection of design and engineering—from building fan sites
as a kid to designing products at Stripe, Asana, and Notion. Now he's rethinking how software itself gets made.

On this episode of Design Review, Ryo joins YC's Aaron Epstein to break down how great product websites communicate what
a company does. They walk through sites from early-stage startups, calling out the small choices in structure, clarity,
and brand that help users understand a product instantly — and the ones that get in the way.
