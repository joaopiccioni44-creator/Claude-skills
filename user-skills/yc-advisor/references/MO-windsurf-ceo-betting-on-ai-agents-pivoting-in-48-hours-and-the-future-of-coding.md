Varun Mohan didn't set out to build one of the fastest-growing AI developer tools. He just knew his company had to
change, or die.   
  
After initially betting on GPU virtualization, he saw the writing on the wall: if there was a future for his company, it
would be at the AI application layer, not infra. Over a single weekend, he and his team pivoted to building Windsurf— a
tool to help everyone, both technical and non-technical, write code faster and smarter.  
  
In this conversation, Varun shares the inside story of how they pivoted at the edge of failure, trained new models from
scratch, outpaced giants like GitHub Copilot, and what the future of building with AI looks like.
