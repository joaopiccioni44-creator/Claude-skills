Imagine flying from NY to London in just a few hours. That’s the future that Blake Scholl and his team at Boom
Supersonic are working towards.   
  
Blake started as a software engineer and pivoted mid-career to aviation. Now, he’s at the forefront of trying to bring
back supersonic travel for all of us.   
  
In this episode of Hard Tech, YC’s Jared Friedman visited Blake in the Mojave desert to find out how someone who didn’t
have a background in aerospace engineering was able to build the first-ever independently developed supersonic plane.
