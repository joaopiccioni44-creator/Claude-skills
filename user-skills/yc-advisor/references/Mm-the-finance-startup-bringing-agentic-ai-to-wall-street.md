Brothers Chaz and Arnie Englander started Model ML after building and selling two YC companies.

What began as a tool to help them analyze deals has grown into a full AI-powered workspace purpose-built for financial
services, empowering firms to create automations and workflows that reflect exactly how their teams operate. And it's
already being used by 10% of the world's top investment banks and private equity firms to automate everything from
client-ready PowerPoint decks to deep-dive research and due diligence.

In this conversation with YC Partner Gustaf Alstromer, they discuss going from internal tool to production platform, the
power of perseverance, and their ambition to build a billion-dollar company with just ten people.
