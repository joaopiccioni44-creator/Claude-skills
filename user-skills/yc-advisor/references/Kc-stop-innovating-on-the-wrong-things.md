Founders by definition have no limit to their job responsibilities, so they often get pulled in a millions directions at
once.

  
Meanwhile they’ve heard stories of founder heroes that did *everything* from scratch — building the entire tech stack,
picking paint colors and designing every inch and angle of the office, walking on water — and believe that to be
successful they must get this granular about every aspect of their startup.

In this episode of Dalton & Michael we’ll discuss the downsides of trying to “innovate” on best practices and why that
can make it *less* likely a company succeeds.
