It’s the first guest episode of Lightcone\! The hosts sit down with Paul Buchheit, one of Google’s earliest employees,
the creator of Gmail and a YC Group Partner. (He also came up with Google’s famous tagline “Don’t be evil.”) This
discussion covers a wide range of topics, including the future of AGI, the early days of OpenAI, and the crucial
importance of open source models.
