# OpenClaw Installation Skill

OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices, connecting to messaging channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥22** (required)
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Git** (for source builds)

Verify Node version:
```bash
node --version  # Must be v22.x or higher
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: NPM Global Install (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or with pnpm:
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest

# Run onboarding wizard
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

The wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux) so it stays running.

### Method 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw

pnpm install
pnpm ui:build      # Auto-installs UI deps on first run
pnpm build

pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)
pnpm gateway:watch
```

### Method 3: Docker

See `references/docker-setup.md` for containerized deployment.

### Method 4: Nix

```bash
# Using nix-clawdbot
nix flake show github:openclaw/nix-clawdbot
```

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start gateway
openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose

# Send a message
openclaw message send --to +1234567890 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"

# Talk to the assistant
openclaw agent --message "Ship checklist" --thinking high

# Health check
openclaw doctor

# Update OpenClaw
openclaw update --channel stable
```

## Configuration

Minimal config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
  }
}
```

For full configuration options, see `references/configuration.md`.

## Channel Setup

Each channel requires specific configuration. Quick overview:

| Channel | Key Config | Auth Method |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| WhatsApp | `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` | QR code via `openclaw channels login` |
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `channels.telegram.botToken` | BotFather token |
| Slack | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | Slack App OAuth |
| Discord | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or `channels.discord.token` | Discord Bot token |
| Signal | `channels.signal` section | signal-cli setup |
| iMessage | macOS only, Messages signed in | Native integration |

For detailed channel setup, see `references/channels.md`.

## Security Defaults

OpenClaw treats inbound DMs as **untrusted input** by default:

- **DM pairing** (`dmPolicy="pairing"`): Unknown senders receive a pairing code
- Approve senders: `openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code>`
- For open access: set `dmPolicy="open"` with `"*"` in allowlist

Run `openclaw doctor` to check for risky configurations.

## Directory Structure

```
~/.openclaw/
├── openclaw.json       # Main configuration
├── credentials/        # Channel credentials (auto-generated)
├── workspace/          # Agent workspace
│   ├── AGENTS.md       # Injected prompt
│   ├── SOUL.md         # Personality config
│   ├── TOOLS.md        # Tool definitions
│   └── skills/         # Local skills
└── state/              # Runtime state
```

## Skills Management

```bash
# Install from ClawdHub
clawhub install <skill-name>

# Sync all skills
clawhub sync --all

# List installed skills
openclaw skills list
```

Skills load from:
1. `<workspace>/skills` (highest priority)
2. `~/.openclaw/skills`
3. Bundled skills (lowest priority)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Node version too old:**
```bash
# Install Node 22 via nvm
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

**Gateway won't start:**
```bash
openclaw doctor          # Diagnose issues
openclaw gateway --verbose  # See detailed logs
```

**Channel connection fails:**
```bash
openclaw channels status
openclaw channels login    # Re-authenticate
```

**Permission denied (macOS):**
- Grant Terminal/IDE full disk access in System Preferences
- For Voice Wake: grant microphone access

### Logs

```bash
# View gateway logs
tail -f ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log

# Debug mode
openclaw gateway --verbose --debug
```

## Development Channels

- **beta**: Prerelease (`vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`), npm dist-tag `beta`
